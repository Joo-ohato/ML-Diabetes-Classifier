Background Information 
The management of a certain NGO Hospital would like to have a product developed that would predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
The data were collected and made available by “The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. 
Several constraints were placed on selecting these instances from a larger database.
In particular, all patients here belong to the Pima Indian heritage (a subgroup of Native Americans) and are females of ages 21 and above
